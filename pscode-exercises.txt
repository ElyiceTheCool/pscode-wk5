// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

sum = x + y

// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

if number == even:
    print(f"{str(number)} is even!")
else:
    print(f"{str(number)} is odd!")

// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

a) num_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
b) average = (sum(num_list))/(len(num_list))
c) min = min(num_list), max = max(num_list)
d) // Average of five numbers in given list
print(f"The average of your numbers is {average}.")

// Gives minimum and maximum of given list
print(f"The smallest number in your list is {min}.")
print(f"The largest number in your list is {max}.")
